Project Description

This project is on the patterns garnerd from hospital data from the NHS labelled the National Diabetes Footcare Audit (NDFA),  which focuses on patients diagnosed with Diabetic foot ulcers. 
Diabetes is becoming an increasingly prominant within the United Kingdom (UK) and with the aid of data gathered by the NHS, we will be able to determine patterns within patients records providing possible pathways to postive outcomes of patient health.
My motivation stems from a Biomedical background and the idea to contribute to the health of each individual with fact based knowledge. 
The problem is to optimize patient care and provide factual evidence on possible measure for resource allocation.
